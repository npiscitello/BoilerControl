* thing to do
- thing already done

* integrate MetaManagement to main - its doing the same function, just as a class. It was useful when
	everything was in one file, not anymore.  The other classes should make it readable enough.
* eliminate Timer class
	- delegate full thermistor control to IO class only
		* not IO's job to keep track of the value; main does that
	* update display only when IO display update method called
		* only call IO display update method when something changes
	* delegate timing to main - use millis() to compare with every call of execute()
		* use this as a periodic task timer for thermistor reading and (possibly, if above doesn't work)
			display outputting
		* use this as a timer for circulators
* possibly integrate EEPROM class into IO - depends on how complex the functions are to manage it
				
* WHEN newly structured code works, implement EEPROM save/restore



IO TASKS:
	- provide an interface to read/write:
		- display(s)
		- buttons/switches/encoders/etc
		- sensors (thermistor, etc)
		
EEPROM TASKS:
	- provide an interface to read/write EEPROM memory
	- optionally keep track of other variables (not in eeprom)
	
MAIN TASKS:
	- timing
	- keep track of variables
	- do cool stuff
