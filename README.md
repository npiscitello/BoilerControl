# BoilerControl
Simple Arduino C code for a project to run heating system circulators to prevent freezing pipes. See https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zT9HgJFU and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3lGJhgluZM6dnlmbTZnVjBCd0k?usp=sharing for more details (specifically, board designs).

This branch holds the avr-gcc port of the original ArduinoIDE code. This is all in C with all from-scratch libraries.
